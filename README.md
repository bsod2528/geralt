## Brief 

A simple discord bot based on [**Discord.py**](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/) API Wrapper. Named after the legendary protagonist [**Geralt of Rivia**](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Geralt_of_Rivia#:~:text=Geralt%20of%20Rivia%20was%20a%20legendary%20witcher%20of,tumultuous%20relationship%2C%20and%20became%20Ciri%20%27s%20adoptive%20father.). However, there are no commands related to the game or the series and the name for this bot came as I have a fond for the game and Geralt. 

## Documentation 

The website provides full details from A to Z regarding the bot. [**Click here**](https://bsod2528.github.io/Posts/Geralt/) to access it. All the commands, how to use them, how to setup the bot, etc. have been documented.

## Setup 

An `.env` file has to be there for storing the keys. You can use any other method too like a json lmao. Just saying. Set up a venv too.

Ensure all tables are present in your [**postgresql**](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) server. Check out `Schema` folder for all the tables you need. 
```py
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the above command to install the packages you need for running Geralt's instance.
The [**website**](https://bsod2528.github.io/Posts/Geralt) provided above provides all necessary details for setting up and running your very own instance of Geralt.
